# Valchione

## Intro
Valchione is a tactical card-based rpg. It is similar to Fire Emblem, but players will be able to summon units with cards. 
This is a project I work on during my spare time. This project has been discontinued.



## Technologies Used:

* Java - Server-Side Programming Language
* Maven - Dependency Manager
* JPA with Hibernate - ORM used to interface server applications with database
* Servlets - used for server-client communication using HTTP

* Unity3D - game engine
* C# - Client-Side Language

* Tiled - Map Maker
* Sketch - Portraits
* Blender - 3d Models



## Discontinuation
This project has been discontinued. Instead, a similar game is being recreated in https://llnorthpolell.github.io/tcg-tactics/ with PhaserJS.
In my opinion, PhaserJS is a much better tool for this type of game. I feel much more productive with it without too many distractions!

### Challenges
- Unity updates caused major changes to environment
- Game had moving complexity (always changing requirements, no plan from the start)
- Unity environment was distracting (overwhelming features, especially for a 2D/2.5D game)

### Lessons Learned
- create a Game Design document 
- keep a dev log
- keep the game simple and take it slow
